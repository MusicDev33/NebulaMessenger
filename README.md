# NebulaMessenger
This is a Messenger App I made my sophomore year of college with a few people working on other aspects (Android, web, marketing, etc.) The project gave way to newer and better ideas, but this is the first real "app" I built that has had users (maxed out at 75ish people), so I'm keeping it here for all to see. Keep in mind this is A) Not maintained anymore and B) Very poor quality code, though I did learn a lot about what NOT to do.

# Security
Keep in mind that all domains and Firebase accounts associated with the app have been shut down. I you do want to try the app out, it will not work at all. I'm trying to get a legacy version of the app running, but I don't think it's going to happen.
