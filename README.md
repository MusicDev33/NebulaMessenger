# NebulaMessenger
This is a Messenger App I made my sophomore year of college with a few people working on other aspects (Android, web, marketing, etc.) The project gave way to newer and better ideas, but this is the first real "app" I built that has had users (maxed out at 75ish people), so I'm keeping it here for all to see. Keep in mind this is A) Not maintained anymore and B) Very poor quality code, though I did learn a lot about what NOT to do.
